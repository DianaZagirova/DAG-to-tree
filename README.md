# DAG-to-tree
The code for conversion of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) to a tree (an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path). 

The "sample_DAG2tree_run.py" file demonstrates the sample usage for conversion of The Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) disease graph into the tree.
